# A Probabilistic Niching Evolutionary Computation Framework Based on Binary Space Partitioning  


## Introduction

The probabilistic niching evolutionary computation framework is proposed to solve multi-modal optimization problems (MMOP) using non-visiting mechanism.  An enhanced binary space partition tree is built to structurally organize the space visiting information. Based on the tree, a probabilistic niching strategy is defined to reinforce exploration and exploitation by making full use of the structural historical information. The proposed framework is universal for incorporating various baseline MMOP optimizers.   

## Usage 

`$ make`
Two executable files named PNF_DE and PNF_PSO are available in the current directory.
`$ ./sh`
Run the codes in the terminal.
